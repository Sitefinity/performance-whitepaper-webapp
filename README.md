The Quantum sample project showcases all Sitefinity CMS features available out of the box in an aesthetically designed website. This starter kit is designed to help business users get up to speed quickly using Sitefinity CMS and gives developers a way to easily add custom features to it. The Quantum website is perfect for doing Sitefinity CMS demos to project stakeholders.

The main purpose of the Quantum project is to provide a real life example of how users can practically utilize the core features of Sitefinity CMS thus bringing value to organizations by empowering non-technical employees to quickly and efficiently manage their content.

The Quantum project is based on few principles:

• It involves minimum customization done by developers, so that the focus lies on the core features of the CMS 
• Pages are built and assembled with the goal to give maximum power to non-technical content editors 
• It provides styling best practices, so that designers can use it as a reference and styling example

Some of the main highlights of the Quantum project include:

- responsive design
- multilingual environment
- social media features
- personalization
- workflows
- email campaigns
- Google maps usage
- blogging
- forums
- usage of dynamic modules
- usage of add-ons
- full-blown online shop
